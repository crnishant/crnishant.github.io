						The obvious answer: an alarm clock. But why do I choose
						to not hit "Snooze" and fall back asleep? I see each
						day as a unique opportunity to learn. You never know

						I am, and will always be, a student, and each day presents

				<p class="card-text">
					I have always liked puzzles. As a kid, I enjoyed solving, 
					100, 200, even 1000 piece puzzles with my dad, mom, and 
					brother. I liked how the pieces fit together, each piece 
					having an impact on the final picture. Get one piece wrong 
					and the entire final picture is incorrect.
					<br/><br/>
					Computer Science is very similar. Each small variable, 
					method, class, or object plays a role in the end 
					functionality of the program. When I code, I think of 
					how each aspect of the program serves a purpose in terms 
					of getting the anticipated end result. My brain simply 
					works like that, connecting every small detail to the big 
					picture. And, just like that, a young kid who loved doing 
					puzzles became a computer scientist.

				<h5 class="card-title">Why Finance?</h5>
				<p class="card-text">
					I remember as a child sitting in the backseat of the car and 
					listening to the radio. Every now and then, my parents would
					turn on the news and I would hear some reporter blabber about
					the "Dow", or the "S&P", and sometimes the "NASDAQ". 
					<br/><br/>
					Later, in high school, we did a stock market simulation. This 
					kindled my interest in the markets, and I starteng more
					attention to the financial news. By college, I knew that finance
					was something that I knew I wanted to pursue. The idea of monitoring
					markets and valuing companies was very interesting to me and I knew
					it was something that I wanted to continue in college. Now, I 
					am a sector head in the prestigious Blue Hen Investment Club and 
					manage my own portfolio on the side. Talk about a bullish trend.

				<h5 class="card-title">Both?</h5>
				<p class="card-text">
					Many people have great ideas. However, why is it so often 
					that those ideas get lost due to fear of starting a business 
					or the lack of knowledge on how to start one? It may take an 
					engineer to make the product, but it takes a businessman/woman 
					to sell it.
					<br/><br/>
					I realized this and thought "what's stopping me from taking on 
					both fields?" Nothing. I have a passion for both, and pursuing
					both has allowed me to see the many connections between the 
					seemingly different fields.	Hopefully, somewhere down the road, 
					I can use my computer science knowledge to create a product and 
					my finance knowledge to give it to the world.

			  <p class="lead" style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
				  Whether we're talking about applying for a new job or moving to a 
				  different home, fear can cloud someone's thoughts. What I have found
				  personally beneficial is to look past the fear because underneath
				  the "costume", you might find a new opportunity for growth and learning.
