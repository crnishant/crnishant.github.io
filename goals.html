						Sometimes to get from point A to point B, you'll have a bridge like 
						the one above. Other times, you won't. That's where goals come in. 
						Goals help us plan our lives. I envision my goals by writing them on
						my white board on my desk. I see them everyday, and they serve as a 
						reminder to constantly put my best foot forward and excel.

				As Steve Jobs once said, "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and 
				a follower." I live by this quote, constantly trying to think of new 
				ingenious ideas as simple as a fidget spinner coffee-stirrer or as 
				complex as a startup idea to deploy a new, more efficient platform for 
				nonprofits to connect with volunteers. Only with creativity will there 
				be change and growth.

					Whoever said the moon landing was going to be a piece of cake? 
					Every and any great accomplishment never came about without a 
					burning passion to accomplish a goal. My passion is what keeps 
					me motivated to succeed regardless of any obstacles in my path. 
					Ultimately, my passion is what will determine who I am and what 
					I will achieve.

				<p class="card-text">
					I would have never thought in a million years that I would win 
					an intramural ultimate frisbee championship. Nor did I think 
					that I'd find myself at a Hackathon at Princeton, guzzling down 
					Red Bull as I code through all hours of the night. But my open 
					attitude and willingness to try new things allowed me to see my 
					new passions. In continuing to maintain this open attitude, not 
					only will I try new things, but I will also meet new people, go 
					to new places, and discover the nuances that allow me to enjoy life.
